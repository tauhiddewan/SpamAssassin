# SpamAssassin


SpamAssassin is an advanced machine learning-based spam detection system that uses a powerful language model called Roberta to check whether incoming messages are spam or non-spam. With the ever-increasing amount of unwanted messages, spam detection has become a critical issue for businesses and individuals alike. The SpamAssassin project aims to solve this problem using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

### Methodology:

The SpamAssassin project uses a combination of SMS, email, and Twitter spam datasets for training the model. The dataset is first preprocessed and tokenized, and the resulting encodings and labels are stored as features. These features are then used to train the model using Roberta, a highly accurate and efficient language model. The training dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model accurately.

Once the model is trained, it is optimized and converted into ONNX format. The model is then tested against the old training, and if the new trained model exceeds the older version, the old model asset is replaced with the new one. The whole training pipeline is reproducible as the pipeline is defined, and the dataset and model assets are also version controlled to maintain consistency.

### Deployment:

The SpamAssassin project is deployed on AWS Lambda, a highly scalable and cost-effective compute service that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. The web app, which enables users to input message prompts, is hosted on an EC2 server.

When a user inputs a message prompt, the web app sends a request to the AWS Lambda function, which then uses the SpamAssassin model to determine whether the message is spam or non-spam. The result is then returned to the web app, which displays the output to the user. The SpamAssassin system can be integrated with almost anything to monitor user activities, making it a versatile and useful tool for businesses and individuals alike.

### Conclusion:

The SpamAssassin project is an excellent example of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems. By leveraging powerful language models like Roberta, the project has created a highly accurate and efficient spam detection system that can be deployed at scale. With its reproducible training pipeline and version control features, the SpamAssassin project is an excellent model for other machine learning-based projects. Overall, the project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to solve some of the most pressing problems facing businesses and individuals today.
